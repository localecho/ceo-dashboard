## 🎯 Design Philosophy

This dashboard embodies the principle from the original product description:

> **"Manual entry by design"** - Takes only 10 minutes per week but builds deeper understanding and ownership of your numbers.

Key principles implemented:
1. **One page overview** - Everything at a glance
2. **Focus on bottlenecks** - One constraint at a time
3. **Data-driven decisions** - Clear metrics, not gut feelings
4. **Weekly rhythm** - Consistent review process
5. **Simple is better** - No unnecessary complexity

- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Cash Flow

### Marketing (2)

### Operations (2)

## 🏆 Success Metrics

You'll know the dashboard is working when:
- ✅ Weekly reviews take < 15 minutes

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Consistency is key** - Same time every week
2. **Be honest with data** - Bad news doesn't improve with age
3. **Focus on one bottleneck** - Multitasking dilutes impact
4. **Celebrate greens** - Acknowledge what's working
5. **Keep it simple** - Don't overcomplicate
