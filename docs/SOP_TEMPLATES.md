## 💡 Best Practices

- ✅ Same time, same day for reviews (builds habit)
- ✅ Enter data even if it's bad (face reality)
- ✅ Focus on one bottleneck at a time

- ✅ Keep notes brief but specific

### Don'ts
- ❌ Skip weeks (breaks momentum)

### Time-Saving Tips
1. **Batch data collection**: Gather all numbers before starting entry
2. **Use shortcuts**: Bookmark the dashboard URL
3. **Set reminders**: Calendar blocks for all reviews
